# StoreMesh Figma Make production prototype

This folder keeps the reproducible source prepared for Figma Make as Version 29 on 2026-09-15.

## What is included

- `ProductionWorkbench.tsx`: shared same-session production ledger, routing, process cycles, results, and event history without user-facing test controls.
- `SortingScreen.tsx`: multi-container input sorting with one-at-a-time weighed outputs, operator-selected final routes, automatically weighted parent contributions, load-cell simulation, existing-container scans, and child genealogy.
- `ProductionInventory.tsx`: production output integration for Inventory and Trace.
- `WebApp.tsx`: the complete assembled Figma Make source snapshot.
- `HubApp.tsx`: the Figma Make hub source with the updated 20-screen Web count.
- `assemble.mjs`: deterministic assembler for a baseline or for refreshing an already assembled snapshot.
- `production.test.mjs`: focused storage and production-domain regression tests.

## Rebuild and verify

```powershell
node prototypes/figma/assemble.mjs <baseline-WebApp.tsx> prototypes/figma/WebApp.tsx
$env:PROTOTYPE_TYPESCRIPT='<path-to-typescript-package>'
node --test prototypes/figma/production.test.mjs
```

The assembled source must also pass the downloaded Figma project's TypeScript check and `pnpm build` before it is installed through the Figma Make code editor.

Version 29 separates physical storage, operational destination, and required process. Receiving offers exactly three cold-room locations and a separate QC hold. Base Data includes configurable operational destinations with applicability. Sorting preserves physical location, selects one of the approved operational outcomes, adds Freeze Sliced, and records disposal weight without allocating a basket. Washing and Slicing use route-aware physical handoffs and expose QC holds. Version 28's persisted Sorting session and automatic proportional parent genealogy remain intact.

## Scope boundary

This is a browser-local interactive prototype. Its production records are saved in `localStorage` under `storemesh.prototype.production.v1`, and its independent master-data records under `storemesh.prototype.master-data.v1`. It neither calls StoreMesh APIs nor controls factory equipment. The behavior alignment and known differences from the current backend are recorded in `docs/ui-backend-change-control.md`.
