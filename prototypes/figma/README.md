# StoreMesh Figma Make production prototype

This folder keeps the reproducible source installed in Figma Make as Version 22 on 2026-09-14.

## What is included

- `ProductionWorkbench.tsx`: shared same-session production ledger, routing, process cycles, results, and event history without user-facing test controls.
- `SortingScreen.tsx`: multi-container input sorting with one-at-a-time weighed outputs, operator-selected final routes, exact parent contributions, load-cell simulation, existing-container scans, and child genealogy.
- `ProductionInventory.tsx`: production output integration for Inventory and Trace.
- `WebApp.tsx`: the complete assembled Figma Make source snapshot.
- `HubApp.tsx`: the Figma Make hub source with the updated 20-screen Web count.
- `assemble.mjs`: deterministic assembler for a baseline or for refreshing an already assembled snapshot.
- `production.test.mjs`: focused storage and production-domain regression tests.

## Rebuild and verify

```powershell
node prototypes/figma/assemble.mjs <baseline-WebApp.tsx> prototypes/figma/WebApp.tsx
$env:PROTOTYPE_TYPESCRIPT='<path-to-typescript-package>'
node --test prototypes/figma/production.test.mjs
```

The assembled source must also pass the downloaded Figma project's TypeScript check and `pnpm build` before it is installed through the Figma Make code editor.

Version 22 keeps the existing visual design while placing the Persian Web sidebar on the right and making the Washing input scan simulator propose the first eligible basket automatically. Version 21's corrected Sorting entry session and Version 20's Receiving-to-Sorting boundary remain intact.

## Scope boundary

This is a browser-local interactive prototype. Its production records are saved in `localStorage` under `storemesh.prototype.production.v1`, and its independent master-data records under `storemesh.prototype.master-data.v1`. It neither calls StoreMesh APIs nor controls factory equipment. The behavior alignment and known differences from the current backend are recorded in `docs/ui-backend-change-control.md`.
