# StoreMesh Figma Make production prototype

This folder keeps the reproducible source installed in Figma Make as Version 17 on 2026-09-13.

## What is included

- `ProductionWorkbench.tsx`: shared same-session production ledger, routing, process cycles, results, and event history without user-facing test controls.
- `SortingScreen.tsx`: multi-container input sorting with one-at-a-time weighed outputs, operator-selected final routes, exact parent contributions, load-cell simulation, existing-container scans, and child genealogy.
- `ProductionInventory.tsx`: production output integration for Inventory and Trace.
- `WebApp.tsx`: the complete assembled Figma Make source snapshot.
- `HubApp.tsx`: the Figma Make hub source with the updated 20-screen Web count.
- `assemble.mjs`: deterministic assembler for a baseline or for refreshing an already assembled snapshot.
- `production.test.mjs`: focused storage and production-domain regression tests.

## Rebuild and verify

```powershell
node prototypes/figma/assemble.mjs <baseline-WebApp.tsx> prototypes/figma/WebApp.tsx
$env:PROTOTYPE_TYPESCRIPT='<path-to-typescript-package>'
node --test prototypes/figma/production.test.mjs
```

The assembled source must also pass the downloaded Figma project's TypeScript check and `pnpm build` before it is installed through the Figma Make code editor.

Version 17 keeps the existing visual design and completes the shared interaction model. Users now has validated persisted create/edit/cancel behavior; receiving inventory uses explicit current location, state, destination, and next operator action; the receiving-to-cold-room-to-sorting path is confirmed by scan rather than a generic transfer state. One scan simulator is reused by receiving, production movement, washing output, packaging, and shipping, and simulator/hardware entry call the same validators. Production items are normalized on every read/write so movement metadata cannot silently disappear. Version 16 master-data, sorting, optional weighing, and multi-input/multi-output washing behavior remains intact.

## Scope boundary

This is a browser-local interactive prototype. Its production records are saved in `localStorage` under `storemesh.prototype.production.v1`, and its independent master-data records under `storemesh.prototype.master-data.v1`. It neither calls StoreMesh APIs nor controls factory equipment. The behavior alignment and known differences from the current backend are recorded in `docs/ui-backend-change-control.md`.
